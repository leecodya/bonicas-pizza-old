                    <p>Bonica’s Pizza began operations in Roberta, Georgia in 2006 after a trip from Italy. Upon arrival, Denise, locally known as Momma, everyone’s favorite boss, brought with her so many delicious pizza recipes and combinations that she tried herself while over there. She knew from then on that she had to share the authenticity of real Italian ingredients with everyone.</p>

                    <p>In 2008, Momma purchased Kuntry Kitchen in Roberta, Georgia from Lane Watson. Lane had spent almost 15 years building a successful business and excellent reputation in the Roberta area. Lane stayed with the company for a few years before moving on to be with his family in Kentucky. Lane and his wife, Michelle, still reside in Kentucky, and every so often, they come back down for the weekend to visit Michelle’s family here in Roberta.</p>
                    
                    <p>In early 2011, the restaurant was the first of its’ kind with the employment of Nikki Hightower. With Nikki’s experience as a cook at Golden Corral during the morning shift, we brought her into the family in the pursuit of incorporating breakfast into pizza! After a year of her employment, Nikki moved to Atlanta to pursue her career in nursing.</p>

            <p>Cheyanne Goodman was brought into the family in late 2011 due to Nikki’s pursuit of education as breakfast cook. Cheyanne received an Associate’s Degree in Culinary Arts from Fort Valley State University. Cheyanne now works independently from her home in Mississippi where she lives with her husband Jason and daughter Maria to care for her sick mother.</p>
            
            <p>In May 2014, Bonica’s Pizza adopted Mike Whelms as Restaurant Manager while Momma was at the house nursing a broken arm from a slip in the kitchen. Mike Whelms has been close friends to the family for a couple years and received a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Management from Mercer University in 2012. When Momma healed up, she saw what Mike was doing with the company and so Mike is now Restaurant Manager for a new location in Warner Robins. He and his wife Rosanne reside on the beaches of Lake Tobosofkee.</p>
            
            <p>Our most recent hire, Steven Hofton, is going our new head pizza chef. With a sharp mind, he was able to quickly pick up the different recipes and combinations in order to help Momma in the kitchen. He is taking classes at Middle Georgia State University so he may one day own his own record store.</p>
